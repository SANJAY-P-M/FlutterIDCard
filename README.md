CollegeIDCardApp is a Flutter-based mobile application that replicates the design and information of a traditional college ID card in a digital format. It provides a convenient and accessible way for students and staff to carry their ID cards directly on their smartphones.

Key Features:
- Realistic ID Card Representation: The app faithfully recreates the visual design of a college ID card, including your name, photo, college logo, ID number, and other relevant details.

- Digital Backup: Your ID card is securely stored within the app, eliminating the risk of misplacing or losing your physical card. It also serves as a digital backup, ensuring you have access to your ID card even if you forget your physical card at home.
